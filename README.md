# UNIX-project-2
OS course UNIX project 2, some unix utilities implemented

As the second project I created the unix utilities' cat and grep commands. Everything submitted works as instructed and all common error scenarios are considered. I didn’t end up doing the zip and unzip commands, although I did try to create them, but I didn’t get them to work as they should’ve.
The cat command takes one or more files as arguments and prints the output to the screen. The grep command gets a search term as an argument and tries to find matches to the search term in each file or standard input.
